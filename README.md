# Decentralized dApp Review Platform

A blockchain-based review system for Sui dApps with multi-dimensional ratings and community voting.

## Overview

This platform allows users to review Sui dApps (identified by package ID) with:
- **Multi-dimensional ratings** (Security, Usability, Performance, Documentation, Innovation)
- **Immutable reviews** - permanent on-chain records
- **Community voting** - upvote/downvote system with vote changing
- **Anti-spam** - one review per user per dApp

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts (Move)
Located in `dapp_reviews/`

**Core Data Structures:**
- `Review` - Immutable review object with 5-dimensional ratings
- `ReviewRegistry` - Shared registry tracking all reviews
- `VoteRecord` - Shared object preventing double voting

**Key Functions:**
- `create_review()` - Submit a new review
- `upvote_review()` - Upvote a review
- `downvote_review()` - Downvote a review
- `change_vote()` - Change existing vote
- View functions for querying reviews

### Deployment

**Network:** Sui Devnet

**Package ID:**
```
0x0af81f0ee8b71ebd70563826133b1ff85affdaa6b12c5674df8fe1968ba098b2
```

See `dapp_reviews/DEPLOYMENT.md` for complete deployment information and usage examples.

## Features Implemented

âœ… Multi-dimensional rating system (1-5 scale for each dimension)
âœ… One review per user per dApp enforcement
âœ… Immutable reviews (permanent on-chain)
âœ… Upvote/downvote functionality
âœ… Vote changing capability
âœ… 500 character review text limit
âœ… Event emissions for indexing
âœ… Weighted composite score calculation

## Project Status

**Phase 1: Smart Contracts** âœ… Complete
- Move contracts implemented and deployed to Devnet
- All core functionality tested
- Event system for frontend integration

**Phase 2: Frontend** ðŸ”œ Coming Next
- Next.js + React application
- zkLogin integration (Google OAuth)
- Shadcn UI components
- Integration with deployed contracts

## Tech Stack

### Smart Contracts
- Sui Move
- Sui Framework
- Deployed on Sui Devnet

### Frontend (Planned)
- Next.js 15
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Sui TypeScript SDK
- Mysten dApp Kit
- zkLogin for authentication
- Shadcn UI
- Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Sui CLI installed
- Sui wallet with Devnet SUI tokens

### Deploy Contracts

```bash
cd dapp_reviews
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000
```

### Test Contract Interaction

See `dapp_reviews/DEPLOYMENT.md` for examples of:
- Creating reviews
- Voting on reviews
- Querying review data

## Smart Contract Details

### Rating Dimensions

Each review includes ratings (1-5) for:
1. **Security** (30% weight) - Smart contract safety, audits
2. **Usability** (25% weight) - User experience, ease of use
3. **Performance** (20% weight) - Transaction speed, responsiveness
4. **Documentation** (15% weight) - Quality of docs, community support
5. **Innovation** (10% weight) - Uniqueness, feature set

### Composite Score

Calculated as a weighted average:
```
score = (security Ã— 0.30) + (usability Ã— 0.25) + (performance Ã— 0.20) +
        (documentation Ã— 0.15) + (innovation Ã— 0.10)
```

Returned as `u64` (multiplied by 100), e.g., 425 = 4.25/5.00

## Security Features

- âœ… Duplicate review prevention (one per user per dApp)
- âœ… Vote deduplication (prevent double voting)
- âœ… Character limit enforcement (500 chars max)
- âœ… Rating bounds validation (1-5)
- âœ… Immutable review data integrity
- âœ… Shared objects for concurrent access

## Next Steps

1. Build frontend application with zkLogin
2. Implement review browsing and search
3. Add developer response feature
4. Create analytics dashboard
5. Deploy to Sui Testnet
6. Mainnet deployment
