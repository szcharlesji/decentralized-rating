# Decentralized dApp Review Platform

A blockchain-based review system for Sui dApps with multi-dimensional ratings and community voting.

## Overview

This platform allows users to review Sui dApps (identified by package ID) with:
- **Multi-dimensional ratings** (Security, Usability, Performance, Documentation, Innovation)
- **Immutable reviews** - permanent on-chain records
- **Community voting** - upvote/downvote system with vote changing
- **Anti-spam** - one review per user per dApp

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts (Move)
Located in `dapp_reviews/`

**Core Data Structures:**
- `Review` - Immutable review object with 5-dimensional ratings
- `ReviewRegistry` - Shared registry tracking all reviews
- `VoteRecord` - Shared object preventing double voting

**Key Functions:**
- `create_review()` - Submit a new review
- `upvote_review()` - Upvote a review
- `downvote_review()` - Downvote a review
- `change_vote()` - Change existing vote
- View functions for querying reviews

### Deployment

**Network:** Sui Devnet

**Package ID:**
```

bun dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to use the app.

See `FRONTEND.md` for detailed frontend documentation.

### Deploy Smart Contracts (Already Deployed)

```bash
cd dapp_reviews
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000
```

See `dapp_reviews/DEPLOYMENT.md` for examples of direct CLI interaction.

## Smart Contract Details

### Rating Dimensions

Each review includes ratings (1-5) for:
1. **Security** (30% weight) - Smart contract safety, audits
2. **Usability** (25% weight) - User experience, ease of use
3. **Performance** (20% weight) - Transaction speed, responsiveness
4. **Documentation** (15% weight) - Quality of docs, community support
5. **Innovation** (10% weight) - Uniqueness, feature set

### Composite Score

Calculated as a weighted average:
```
score = (security Ã— 0.30) + (usability Ã— 0.25) + (performance Ã— 0.20) +
        (documentation Ã— 0.15) + (innovation Ã— 0.10)
```

Returned as `u64` (multiplied by 100), e.g., 425 = 4.25/5.00

## Security Features

- âœ… Duplicate review prevention (one per user per dApp)
- âœ… Vote deduplication (prevent double voting)
- âœ… Character limit enforcement (500 chars max)
- âœ… Rating bounds validation (1-5)
- âœ… Immutable review data integrity
- âœ… Shared objects for concurrent access
